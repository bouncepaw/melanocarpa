As you know, [[my toots expire]], and on this stream I wanted to show that. Live, I was deboosting and deleting. Some of my toots ended up on [[удалённое из мастодонта]], some boosts ended up being linked somewhere on that garden. Most didn't.

Stats:
* 895 toots before
* ??? toots after?

19 minutes in, I've been rate-limited!! 51 minutes in, I've been rate-limited again!!

A couple of people suggested that I use the built-in toot expiration capability. Turns out, it's not just a brutal reap of older posts, it has some kind of granularity, you can ask it to not delete favorited own posts! I think it's not enough.
