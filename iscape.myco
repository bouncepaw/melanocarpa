> This paper presents iScape, a shared virtual desktop world dedicated to the collaborative exploration and management of information. Data mining and information visualization techniques are applied to extract and visualize semantic relationships in search results. A three-dimensional (3-D) online browser system is exploited to facilitate complex and sophisticated human-computer and human-human interaction.
