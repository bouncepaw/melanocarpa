**What is a [[wiki]]?** No one really knows.

Took some discussions from the [[Fediverse]].

= A discussion with Felix [[2022-05-13]]

@felix@wandering.shop
> It occurs to me that nowadays the word #wiki denotes a practice, not so much a kind of (web) app. An org file can be a wiki if it's used like one. The similarly-named feature on software forges doesn't work in the classic way either. And that's all right.

This semantical shift seems to indeed have happened. I do not like that, though. How do we call what we used to call wiki, then? Wiki? Now, the word has many meanings

> Good question. Roguelikes also went through that, and also never found a good solution.

P. S. There is word //roguelite// now. I think I did respond with that, but that post is nowhere to be found now. Probably deleted by me.

@klardotsh@merveilles.town
> Fair on the hypertext point especially. I guess I should be clear though: I have no problem with Wayne calling it absolutely whatever they'd like to call it :) I personally would probably call a write-only non-collab site of my own a knowledgebase or "docs", but whatever Wayne wants to call their own knowledgebase/wiki/etc isn't worth bikeshedding over

@bouncepaw

@akkartik@merveilles.town
> It seems like there's a continuum here. I have technically the ability to create cross-links in my note-taking system, but the cross-links are pretty sparse. I never create a link before it exists, so (I think) I don't have any broken links. In any case, linear ordering + folders are the dominant organizational primitive. So while you might say my notes aren't really a wiki, I'd say they have "low wiki nature". They don't encourage cross-links. I'm trying to improve that.

@akkartik@merveilles.town
> Does https://permacomputing.net have any tool to enumerate dangling links? (As @bouncepaw said, I don't exactly consider them broken. And we do have enough of them on that wiki that we can't really afford to be as draconian as you are on your wiki.)

@viznut@venera.social

@bouncepaw
