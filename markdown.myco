**Markdown** is a markup language. Seems to be popular. Meant to be simple. My nemesis.

I don't like many things about Markdown, starting with its choice of tokens and its paragraph logic, finishing with the vast amount of dialects and the reasons why they exist in the first place.

Gotta write it here.

The good thing about Markdown is that is has shown many people the joy of lightweight markups.
