**TAL** is the assembly language for [[uxn]], often called **uxntal**. This is the first assembly language I ever had experience with.

=> xxiivv>uxntal

I don't know what //TAL// stands for. Maybe Timur Assembly Language.
**Update:** TAL means //system// in [[xxiivv>lietal]].

I know a bit of uxntal, I used it for my [[uxnerie]] projects.
