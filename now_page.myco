**/now page** is a standard, a page (under address `/now`) on which there is a description of the person's current passions, interests, etc. See [[now]].

The list is ridiculously big to the point of being pointless. On the other hand, I like that there are people following this standard!

~~I think I should make a page like that. Maybe it will be a hypha, maybe a static page. I kinda don't see how [[static site]]s fit with the notion of now-ness, but whatever. Maybe https://lesarbr.es/now will redirect to a hypha. Will see. First, I have to figure what I am about now.
