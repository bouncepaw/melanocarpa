**Uxn** is a small virtual computer by [[100 rabbits]]. It is also somehow accompanied by [[varvara]], not exactly sure how.

> The Uxn ecosystem is a personal computing playground, created to host small tools and games, programmable in its own unique assembly language.
>
> It was designed with an implementation-first mindset with a focus on creating portable graphical applications, the distribution of Uxn projects is akin to sharing game roms for any classic console emulator.
