**Quadrat** is a sketchbook of mine. I publish drawings from it that I like. I hope that it will be the most drawings. Preferably, all of them. Who knows, how it will go.

All Quadrat drawings are part of [[/category/quadrat | their own category]].

See also [[Quadrat gallery]].

The previous sketchbook is known as [[Lapin]]. The next one is [[Marmor]].
