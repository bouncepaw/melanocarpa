This is **Melanocarpa** bus stop, also/more known as **Bouncepedia**. This site is an online collection of links and descriptions of various things, maintained by [[u/bouncepaw]], also known as Timur Ismagilov on some wikis.

This wiki runs [[https://mycorrhiza.wiki | Mycorrhiza]] as its wiki engine. It is developed by me and I use it on multiple wikis.
