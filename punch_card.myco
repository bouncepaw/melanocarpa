**Punch card** is a cardboard card with punched out holes in it that encode information. I've never seen one. I am somewhat fascinated by the concept.

Now think about #uxn machines running programs on punch cards

Humans may be bad at handling large data, but they have the best branch prediction out there â€” intuition.
