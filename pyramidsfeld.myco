**Pyramidsfeld** is a location on [[Fleighsborough]], one of the largest [[Flying Islands]].

It is a big field full of pyramidal and conical structures of varying size all around it. There is a long pavement spanning through the field in the middle. If you go down the pavement, you will exit the field territory and enter a train station. The trains are rare, but you will be able to catch one for sure. They always come in the end.
