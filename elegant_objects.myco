**Elegant Objects** is an opinionated approach on how to OOP by Yegor Bugayenko. It takes the idea //everything is an object// to the next level.

There is a book with a cactus on the cover, I have the Russian edition of it.

By the way, Yegor inserts screenshots from random Western movies into his articles for no real reason. I dislike that.
