**Tsukumizu**, often written as //tkmiz//, is a mangaka, known for //Girls' Last Tour// and //Shimeji Simulation//. Both mangas are ended now, waiting for a new project.

Little is known about them. The consensus is that they are a fish, and that's it.

They have designed quite a lot of characters. My favorite character is **Shimeji's elder sister**, who is an elder sister of Shimeji, another character. Her name remains unknown to this day.

One can see a lot of their influence in my art. All this [[pipepunk | pipe hyperfixation]] started with //Girls' Last Tour//. And the [[рыба | fish hyperfixation]] started with //Shimeji Simulation//. Sometimes, when people describe me, they reference my pipe and fish tastes. Thank you Sensei, people now see me as a fish maniac.
