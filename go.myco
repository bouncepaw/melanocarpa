> Go creates static binaries by default unless you use cgo to call C code, in which case it will create a dynamically linked binary. Using cgo is more common than many people assume as the os/user and net packages use cgo, so importing either (directly or indirectly) will result in a dynamic binary.

> SQLite is a wonderful piece of software and it is completely meaningful to use it in a project written in Go even though SQLite itself is in C. Though people has been hitting lots of issues with it, mostly "database is locked" error that seems to appear out of nowhere.
>
> First of all, SQLite allows concurrent readers but only a single writer. Unlike most places where you may encounter some sort of synchronization SQLite does not wait for the write lock to become available - instead it just returns an error, letting the caller deal with it. This is why you are getting "database is locked" errors.

> Perhaps the matter I most appreciate Go for is its long-term commitment to simplicity, stability, and robustness. I prize these traits more strongly than any other object of software design. The Go team works with an ethos of careful restraint, with each feature given deliberate consideration towards identifying the simplest and most complete solution, and they carefully constrain the scope of their implementations to closely fit those solutions. The areas where Go has failed in this regard are frightfully scarce.

> В спеке Go указано, что присваивание x типа V к переменной типа T валидно в случае, если V и T основаны на одинаковых типах и T — не именованный тип  ("x's type V and T have identical underlying types and at least one of V or T is not a defined type."). Псевдонимы типов не считются именованными типами, так что мы можем принимать в аргумент n любую кастуемую структуру.

Про голянг понятно. Про остальное:
> PowerShell or the pwsh, is far better shell than bash and unix bag friends. 
> Mathematica, is the programing language far beyond any other in the computing industry. A magnitude beyond all existing. It is more than a programing language, because it is really a computational knowledge base. Asides from math functions, such as solving equations or integration symbolically and hundreds other special math functions only a handful mathematician understands, it also embodies just about every practical algorithm in computer science. So, given a algorithm, you might write it in lang X for a hour or days, but Mathematica has it as part of the language, just call a function. Mathematica has few thousand functions builtin, not even needing to load a library.
