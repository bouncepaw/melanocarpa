**Blame!** is a [[pipepunk]] manga by Tsutomu Nihei. A hard but worthy read.

I have the first volume physically in XL Media Russian edition.

I had hard time trying to get into it. [[2022-06-07]] I finally managed to do so and //really// enjoy it.

What is cool:
* Cool architecture
* Cool body horror

Visual story telling is difficult.

It influenced [[Girls' Last Tour]] very much.
