**Dithering** is a visual technique that looks extra cool.

[[https://arcadewise.me | Arcade Wise]] taught me how to dither.

You use a program called [[https://github.com/makeworld-the-better-one/didder/ | Didder]].

Then run a command like that:
```sh
didder -i <filename> -o <output_filename> --palette 'black gray white' --recolor "#002b36 #839496 #fdf6e3" edm --serpentine FloydSteinberg
```
