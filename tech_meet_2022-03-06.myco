The first [[tech meet]]. We took these notes together in [[riseup pad]], the meeting took place in [[Lion's internet office]].

= Participants
* Me
* Lion Kimbro
* Ciprian Craciun

= What has been happening (Lion)
* Sacred vs Divine
** Sacred is passive
** Divine is something happening (driven by God, sometimes)
** Holy books are both
* Biosphere 2 project
* [[The Glass Bead Game]] by [[Hermann Hesse]]
** Timur has read it, others have not

= Software engineering in eastern Europe universities
* the topic of //weird spaces//: {
```
someobject.method (arg1, arg2, arg3) .method2 ()
someobject.method ( arg1, arg2, arg3 ).method2 ()
someobject
.method(arg1, arg2, arg3)
.method2()
```
}
* the language of choice in RU is C\++;
* Timur would have preferred C, Python or Scheme;
* Ciprian's bash style (no functions, the script calls itself, and the function //bodies//, are actually contained as arms inside a big `case`;)
* both Lion and Ciprian think that perhaps Basic (or Logo) is a better introductory language;
* [[https://www.hmc.edu/]] the college Lion went to;
* man pages distribution?
* embed source code go:embed â€” [[https://github.com/volution/z-run/blob/development/sources/embedded/build.go]]
