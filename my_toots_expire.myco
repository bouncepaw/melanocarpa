**My toots expire** is the philosophy of getting rid of older toots.

Originally, I saw this phrase used by [[Alex Schroeder]]. In his [[https://octodon.social/@kensanata | Fediverse account]], he says so in the bio. His view on the approach is too radical, though. He deletes all old toots. This is cool in its own way.

Toots are to expire, but I think some of them are worthy of preserving. Who is to judge? Me. I judge.

If you subscribe to my [[Mastodon]], you will see my new toots, but one day, when I decide they should disappear from there, they will do so. I move some of them to [[удалённое из мастодонта]]. The rest is gone for good. I use [[toot expirator]] to help me.

Join the movement.
