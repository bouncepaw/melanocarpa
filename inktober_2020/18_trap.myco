2024-01-06 Stumbled across this picture. One might say, “Bouncepaw, but fires cast no shadow!”, to which I would reply the following.

Fires, in fact, do drop shade. But the fire, which is a solid body, has such a low density, that the fire's light destroys this shadow. However, if you light the fire with a //much// brighter light, you can see an actual shadow! It'll be a little transparent and wiggly. Just like on this picture.

I didn't know all of that back in 2020.
