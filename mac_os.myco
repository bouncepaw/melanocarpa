**macOS** is an [[operating system]]. I use it on [[caemlyn]].

[[Safari]] is the best [[web browser]].

According to the article, if you execute the commands below, you will be able to use the web inspector where applicable in macOS system applications.
```sh
defaults write NSGlobalDomain WebKitDeveloperExtras -bool true
defaults write -g WebKitDeveloperExtras -bool YES
```
This is ridiculous! Why would they use webview for that? Well, it's better than [[Electron]], of course.

> Ready to show off your pixel perfect design skills? We're challenging you to embrace the constraints of a grid and design an app icon at pixel level using only black and white colors. When we design icons today, we create work for high-resolution HDR screens, with millions of pixels and color at our disposal. But there’s joy in embracing a bit of retro restraint: pixel grids can help you distill the essence of your design and make sure your icon is clear and understandable at all sizes.
Extra fun with today's off-grid icons
