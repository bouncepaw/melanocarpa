**CuteFish** — окружение рабочего стола для CuteFishOS. Написан на Qt/KDE Framework. Мне нравится их логотип. Отмечают [[Jing OS]] в списке друзей. Я не знаю, интересно ли мне это.

> Cutefish OS is yet another Linux distribution (based on Debian) that came into being within the past couple of years, uses Qt Quick, and (like elementary OS) will immediately remind users of the macOS desktop with a topbar and bottom dock. And even as a beta release, Cutefish brings an incredible elegance into the Linux desktop mix. In fact, upon first logging into the Cutefish OS desktop, I couldn't remember being so excited about a Linux release in years. My first impression of this desktop was, "That's the cutest Linux desktop I've seen in a long time." 
Surprisingly, Cutefish has entered my information field again.
