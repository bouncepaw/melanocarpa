**Linux Mint** is a [[GNU+Linux]] distribution, based on [[Ubuntu]], often recommended as a good choice to beginners. A good choice for beginners is a good choice in general.

Linux Mint comes in many shapes and colors. I tries two of them:
* **Linux Mint Cinnamon**, featuring the original [[Cinnamon]] [[desktop environment]]. This is the first GNU+Linux I used, circa [[2016]], I believe.
* **Linux Mint MATE**, featuring the [[MATE]] DE. This is the one on [[tarvalon]] in [[2021]], [[2022]].
