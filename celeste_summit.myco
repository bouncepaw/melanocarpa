**Celeste summit** is a room in Jitsi, a free video conferencing service. I claim this room as mine.

This is the room I use for meeting with people for various reasons. Some reasons:

* Co-working [[working in public]]
* Discuss the architecture of [[Betula]]

It is one of the few places on the Internet where you can see my face.
