**Toot expirator** is a little program that generates a text excerpt to insert into [[—É–¥–∞–ª—ë–Ω–Ω–æ–µ –∏–∑ –º–∞—Å—Ç–æ–¥–æ–Ω—Ç–∞]], my storage of toots I no longer want to have in my [[Mastodon]] account, and deletes the toot. It is up to me whether I want to save the text to the list.

As I often say, [[my toots expire]]. Mine do so in a manual manner.

= Format
<text> ‚Äî <time> <fav> <boost>, where:
* <text> is the text of the toot.
* Time is the time. Format like this would be the best: 2022-05-08 18:13:08 UTC.
* <fav>
** If the toot is not favorited by anyone, empty
** Else, ‚≠êÔ∏è <number>
* <boost>
** If the toot is not boosted by anyone, empty
** Else, üîÅ <number>
