**Toot expirator** is a little program that generates a text excerpt to insert into [[—É–¥–∞–ª—ë–Ω–Ω–æ–µ –∏–∑ –º–∞—Å—Ç–æ–¥–æ–Ω—Ç–∞]], my storage of toots I no longer want to have in my [[Mastodon]] account, and deletes the toot. It is up to me whether I want to save the text to the list.

As I often say, [[my toots expire]]. Mine do so in a manual manner.

= How to use
* When I want to expire a toot, I open its standalone page.
* I select its URL in the omnibar.
* I select the service called //üêò Toot expirator//.
* The program deletes the toot, and prepares the text excerpt.
* The text excerpt is saved to a file, so I can access it later, and copied to the clipboard, so I can paste right away.

= Format
<text> ‚Äî <time> <fav> <boost>, where:
* <text> is the text of the toot.
* Time is the time. Format like this would be the best: 2022-05-08 18:13:08 UTC.
* <fav>
** If the toot is not favorited by anyone, empty
** Else, ‚≠êÔ∏è <number>
* <boost>
** If the toot is not boosted by anyone, empty
** Else, üîÅ <number>

Example: `* Rageful, tired ‚Äî 2022-04-19 18:08 UTC`. It was once a real toot.

= Implementation
This is a program for [[caemlyn]]. I use [[Automator]]. If you want to adapt the program to something else, you will have to think of a different thing. In the Automator workflow, I have a wrapper that runs `~/src/toot-expirator/toot-expirator.py`, this is the path with the program. I used [[Python]], because there is a [[https://github.com/halcy/Mastodon.py | library]]. Do not forget to install it beforehand: `sudo pip3 install Mastodon.py`.
