**Digital garden** is a metaphor and a practice for a digital resource such as a website, usually managed (“grown”) by one person. Its content is usually placed not chronologically, but in a different way. Incompleteness of content units such as articles is pretty common. An unfinished article is a sapling, and the webmaster is a gardener.

A digital garden is a sort of a [[personal website]].

See [[цифровой сад]] for more information in Russian.

= What to keep? [[2022-07-22]]
Maybe I should delete everything related to things I dislike from my digital garden? Make it a bouncespace with smiles and joy

> I don't think you should delete things that you once liked, and no longer do, I think you should just write that you're ideas about this thing changed instead.

> to me, it feels wrong. i don't write for meticulous care & growth, i write because i'm desperate to (connect, understand, remember, leave something behind)
>
> it reminds me that i'll die someday & i want people to remember who i was, and how i thought. i leave tracings of myself in this abyss, hoping that it'll help other people. it's fragments of me.

> that's no garden. it's a mortal abyss. and i find a lot of meaning staring into it.
