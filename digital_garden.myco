**Digital garden** is a metaphor and a practice for a digital resource such as a website, usually managed (“grown”) by one person. Its content is usually placed not chronologically, but in a different way. Incompleteness of content units such as articles is pretty common. An unfinished article is a sapling, and the webmaster is a gardener.

A digital garden is a sort of a [[personal website]].

See [[цифровой сад]] for more information in Russian.

Maybe I should delete everything related to things I dislike from my digital garden? Make it a bouncespace with smiles and joy
