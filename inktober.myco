**Inktober** is a public event that takes place every October. Artists are to draw using //ink//, hence the name. A special committee publishes a list of topics to draw, and most people use the list. There are numerous alternative lists as well. I follow the official list.

I took part in the following Inktobers:
=> Inktober 2020
=> Inktober 2021
=> Inktober 2022
