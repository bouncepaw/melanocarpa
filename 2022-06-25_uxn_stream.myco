This is the first [[uxn]] stream in the [[summer stream 2022]] series. Today I made a hello world program multiple times. It was fun.

= Errors
Along the way, I have found some minor errors i the text.
* {
> for example, in order to assemble and run darena that is in projects/examples/demos/
Wrong path. The source code lies in `projects`, and the ROM is in `roms`.
}
* {
> wc --bytes hello.rom
Not portable! Did not work on my machine!
}
* {
> it ends up being assembled in the same 30 bytes as the examples above, but hopefully more readable and maintainable.
It's 29 bytes to me
}

= Questions to Devine
* Why spaces around comments? What inspired this design?
* {
Why no space here before the parenthesis?
```
Assembled hello.rom in 5 bytes(0.01% used), 0 labels, 0 macros.
```
Maybe I should make a patch.
}
* How to pronounce //uxn//?

= Meta
* The actual video started 8 minutes in. I should shorten this time.
* Very little people joined during the stream. I do not know how to increase the number to, at least, ten.
* OBS works well. [[Peer Tube]] works well, although the 1 minute delay is present.
