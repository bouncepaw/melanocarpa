**playdate** — очаровательная портативная игровая консоль жёлтого цвета. Слежу за проектом с 2020. Подавал заявку на девкит, мне не дали.

> The device is the result of a collaboration between Teenage Engineering, ++a company who makes disposable electronics++ and Panic, ++a company who writes proprietary development software for the platform that most aggressively fights against the Right To Repair++. Despite that, it's surprisingly easy to open the Playdate and replace its standard 740mAh battery, all is needed is a slotted screwdriver. We did not recieve our pre-sale unit with a disassembly manual nor the tools to open the case. The playdate is lacking select and start buttons, leaving only a d-pad, 2 buttons and a crank.
