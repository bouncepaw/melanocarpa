**December 1st.** Doing a Java assignment for the University. Somehow installed an outdated Mongo DB. I tried to install a new one, but the modern tech hates the old 2020 OS I use on [[Caemlyn]]. The outdated one was found in Nix. Thanks Nix, the only package manager that never fails to install. I didn't learn Mongo though, not yet.

Then I started integrating Lombok, which is a library to reduce boilerplate. Pretty nice!

And during the night I was starting to get the 100 % code coverage. There's still job to be done!
