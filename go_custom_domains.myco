[[2022-08-21]] I tried to [[Mycomarkup]] from older `github.com/bouncepaw/mycomarkup` import path to a new `lesarbr.es/mycomarkup` path (the repo is actually on [[SourceHut]]). It took a lot of time, pain, and confusion. The docs are not really understandable (which is pretty uncommon for Go).

In the end, it didn't really work for 100 %, so I instead moved to `git.sr.ht/~bouncepaw/mycomarkup`. They made it work.
