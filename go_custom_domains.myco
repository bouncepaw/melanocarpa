[[2022-08-21]] I migrated [[Mycomarkup]] from older `github.com/bouncepaw/mycomarkup` import path to a new `lesarbr.es/mycomarkup` path (the repo is actually on [[SourceHut]]). It took a lot of time, pain, and confusion. The docs are not really understandable (which is pretty uncommon for Go).

Will migrate the [[Mycorrhiza]] repo too.
