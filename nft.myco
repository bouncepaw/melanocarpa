The so-called **non-fungible token** idea seems to be a threat to the society. Yet I still don't fully understand it to attack nft-folk.

The basic idea is simple. An NFT is an object that states that a particular object (a URL of a picture on a centralised website, quite often) is owned by a particular person. And it is backed up by some crypto blockchain, most often Ethereum.

This video discusses why the design of many popular NFT collections is often considered ugly. Well, for reasonable reasons.

The video also mentions the drama of Qinni, the artist. After her death, some person has stolen her drawings and sold them as NFTs, getting profit. This is both theft and impersonation, so I find it disgusting. See [[sins]] for an incomplete list of things I find disgusting.

You can take a look at Qinni's drawings on [[https://www.deviantart.com/qinni/gallery | DeviantArt]]. She also has an account on Twitter and Instagram, but I won't link them here. There's a picture drawn by her nearby in this article. It is sourced from DeviantArt's servers and may break any day.

The idea of NFTs is conflicting and I'm strongly inclined to call it heresy. But I'm not sure yet.
