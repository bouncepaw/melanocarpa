**Agora** is a â€˜wiki like experimental social network and distributed knowledge graphâ€™, so they said. I would say it's an aggregator of digital gardens and a community around it. **Anagora** is the first and biggest instance of it. [[Flancian]] was the one who created it and the software behind, but there were other good contributors. Thank you!

I'm part of it:

Agora makes a big emphasis on graphs and links. Their analogue of [[https://mycorrhiza.wiki/help/en/hypha | hyphae]] is called a [[https://anagora.org/node | node]], nodes are generated from contents from multiple sites. There is also a cool notion of push/pull and [[https://anagora.org/go | go]] links!

//I was inspired by Agora's go links and implemented something very similar in [[Betula]].//

The project is interesting. [[2022-01-18]] I wrote the author an email about the possibilities of making Agora and [[Mycorrhiza]] compatible. [[2022-03-06]] Melanocarpa was added to Anagora, along with [[https://github.com/flancian/agora-server/commit/7783430aa33986186e9fd66ee858250b115e0d7e | Mycorrhiza support]]. Furthermore, in 2023 proper support of [[Mycomarkup]] was added.

The Agorans also seem to be using [[git]]-based [[markdown]]-driven digital gardens mostly. It is the default choice for many, but luckily support for more formats was added. Mycorrhiza, for example, is supported! There is also [[Betula in Agora]].

You can't talk about Agora without talking about [[Flancia]].
