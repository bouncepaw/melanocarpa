**Hypha stages** is a concept I am using on Melanocarpa. This idea is present in many other digital gardens as well.

It only relates textual hyphae. I'll leave media hyphae be. They are fine, they do not really evolve. They seem to have a good ontology emerging already.

Mostly empty hyphae shall be called seeds, or //graines// in French. They are in [[/category/graine]].

Hyphae that have some content are saplings, or //semis// in French. They are in [[/category/semis]].

Well-written hyphae, worthy of publishing and thinking about, are trees, or //arbres// in French. They are in [[/category/arbre]].
