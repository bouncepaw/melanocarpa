**Franz Kafka** is a name you have heard. A writer refusing to publish most of his work, a depressed one, I conclude. Died from an illness humans don't need to suffer, ordered his friend to destroy his works in his will. The friend refused to. Many people say that it's a good thing he disobeyed the will. Is it? They are afraid we wouldn't have had Kafka's works. I think it's ok. The will is more important.

Nevertheless, I will not refuse to read Kafka's works just because I think it was unethical to publish them. In this document I shall note my impressions about novels I read.
