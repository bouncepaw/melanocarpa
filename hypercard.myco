> Quasicard is a hypothetical reimagining of HyperCard and TiddlyWiki, born out of my combined frustration and contentment with reading textbooks and taking lab notes on an iPhone and doing exploratory data analysis and algorithm design in IPython/Jupyter.

A really good collection of links with a nice introductory video (30 min). Worth of backing up?

There are numerous application ‘inspired by HyperCard’, all of them is not what we need. Lots of them advertise themselves as a way of making programs without programming. We need a reimplementation of HyperCard for modern systems, not this.

> Decker is a multimedia platform for creating and sharing interactive documents, with sound, images, hypertext, and scripted behavior. It draws strong influence from HyperCard, as well as more modern "no-code" or "low-code" creative tools like Twine and Bitsy. If Jupyter Notebooks are a digital lab notebook, think of Decker as a stack of sticky notes.

Seems like it finally exists. Looks like a classic Mac screen and is open source!
