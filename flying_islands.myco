**Flying Islands** is a confederation of several flying islands in the same archipelago. The closest populated area is [[Solinopolis]]. In an ancient language, this land (or severe lack of thereof) is called //ConfÅ“deratio insularum volantium//.

The habitants are often called Islanders. Sure, on the surface of the planet, there are many literal islands, but these islands are the most notorious ones.
