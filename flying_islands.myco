**Flying Islands** is a confederation of the flying islands in the same archipelago. The closest populated area is [[Solinopolis]].

In an ancient language, this land (or severe lack of thereof) is called //ConfÅ“deratio insularum volantium//. Thus, the Flying Islands are sometimes called CIV or Cinsuvoland.

The habitants are often called Islanders. Sure, on the surface of the planet, there are many islands, but these islands are the most notorious ones.
