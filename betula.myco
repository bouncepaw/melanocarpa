**Betula** is a single-user self-hosted bookmarking tool for the independent web. It is simple to run and use. I started making it at the end of 2022. It is my main project currently. When I program, I usually program Betula.

= Simplest bookmarklet
```js
javascript:window.open(%22https://links.bouncepaw.com/save-link?url=%22+window.location.href+%22&title=%22+document.title,'_blank')
```
Change the URL with your own.

In a future version, a bookmarklet adding interface will be built-in.

= Some BetulÃ¦ I know of
The first one is mine! As you can see, the pattern of using `links` as the subdomain has emerged.

= Relation to [[Mycorrhiza]]
Both projects are part of the [[Mycoverse]]. What does it mean now? Not much, except it means that both projects are heavily connected ideologically and will be connected technically in the future.

Both projects use [[Mycomarkup]] as the only markup language.
