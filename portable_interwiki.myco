**Portable interwiki** is a program I imagine. It is some sort of [[web browser]] extension. Its scope is [[wiki]]s. [[Mycorrhiza]] wikis specifically, I suppose. The idea is simple. It shows how many backlinks the hypha on screen has on your wiki, which might be very private and secret.

When [[Mycoverse]] comes, there might be interwiki backlinks, sure. But they will come with delay, and private wikis cannot be part of it. This extension kinda solves it.
