**Ares logo** is the logotype of [[Ares Corp.]] and its future successor. It's an orange circle with black bezel. Inside, there is a part of a planet, [[Mars]], to be exact, and a four-ray star.

It can also be used without the orange part, and also without the bezel. Just the planet cut and the star.

It may be not the best logo, but it works quite well, and I like that it's unchanged from 2014 or so. I like the continuity.

Since 2022 you can see it appearing on some of my art.
