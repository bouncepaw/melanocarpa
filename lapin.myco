**Lapin** is my first real sketchbook, featuring almost 90 drawings, most of them colored. The name comes from the French //lapin//, meaning rabbit. The cover of the sketchbook had two rabbits on it. I didn't particularly like the rabbits when choosing the sketchbook, I chose it because of the shape. Later on I found the exact same sketchbook model, but with a cute building on it. I would have bought it instead.

I didn't publish it Melanocarpa-first, most of drawings are on [[Cyberrachel]] only. Eventually I will publish all drawings from it that I want to. Some of them will remain on Cyberrachel forever, never to see the light of day.

Currently published drawings are found in [[/category/lapin]].

The next sketchbook is [[Quadrat]].
