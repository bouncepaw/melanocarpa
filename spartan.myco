**Spartan** is a [[smolweb]] protocol, advertised as a [[Gemini]] derivate. In some areas, it is an advancement of its ideas. In others, it is a minimization.

What I absolutely dislike about it is its [[ASCII]] exclusivity. If I ever use it on my server, I will ignore the rule and serve [[UTF-8]].
