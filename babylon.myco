They say, **Babylon** is what is bad, a physical place where they do no good, a disease in our minds that prevents us from being honest. Some people say, that the Western civilization is the Babylon. I think Babylon is not one thing, but rather a property. So, a thing can be a Babylon, a manifestation of Babylon, if I think it is.
