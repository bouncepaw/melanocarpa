**Fediverse** is a decentralized social network, consisting of numerous instances running different software, all compatible with each other to some degree.

Some software are more compatible with each other: Mastodon and Pleroma both implement a similar model, id est microblogging, thus they federate nicely. Some are more different.

Currently, Fediverse is the go-to social network in these layers of the infosphere.

= Bounced Paw VS the Fediverse
I am present on several Fediverse instances.

* [[https://merveilles.town/@bouncepaw]] is my main presence. Follow for mostly English posts and boosts. I most of [[/category/Art]] there as well.
** This instance is running Hometown, which is a fork of Mastodon, optimized for //communities//. Indeed there is a sense of a community here on [[Merveilles]]!
** Before Merveilles, I was on LOR: ~~[[https://lor.sh/@bouncepaw]]~~. [[Devine Lu Linvega]] invited me to Merveilles, and some time afterwards I [[Merveilles migration | migrated]]. I fit there better.
* ++Got distracted, will finish later.
