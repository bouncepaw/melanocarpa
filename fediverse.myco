**Fediverse** is a network of [[federated]] [[social network]]s. I have a [[Mastodon]] account.

> This project represents a new attempt at the social link aggregator service. It is modelled after (old)Reddit, HackerNews, and Lobste.rs trying to combine the good parts of these services while mapping them on the foundation of an ActivityPub generic service called FedBOX.
>
> It targets small to medium communities which ideally focus on a single topic. At the same it allows the community to reach other similar services and the rest of the fediverse ecosystem through the ability to federate.
